# ComfyUI-ScaleLockedResidualDiffusion

A ComfyUI custom node pack implementing a practical MVP of Scale-Locked Residual Diffusion for the specific failure mode where a model behaves well around its native / comfortable resolution (for example ~1 MP) but drifts badly in composition, anatomy, or identity at much higher resolutions.

## What it does

Instead of letting the high-resolution branch freely re-plan the image, the nodes:

1. create a low-resolution planner pass at a target megapixel level,
2. record the planner's per-step denoised x0 trajectory,
3. build nested high-resolution noise so the high-res branch shares the same coarse stochastic layout,
4. run the final high-res sampling with a scale-lock correction that preserves the base model's high-frequency residual detail.

In practice, this is meant to reduce:

- composition drift,
- anatomy drift,
- duplicate limbs / body parts,
- scene re-planning between 1 MP and 4 MP,
- the "looks like a different sample entirely" problem.

## Nodes

### 1. Scale-Locked Residual KSampler

Main all-in-one node. It still owns the full SLRD runtime internally and is the easiest entry point.

**Outputs**
- `output`: final high-res latent
- `lowres_planner`: final low-res planner latent
- `denoised_output`: final high-res denoised x0 latent when available

### 2. Scale-Locked Runtime Context

Builds the reusable SLRD runtime bundle for ComfyUI's modular custom-sampling path.

**Outputs**
- `runtime`: internal SLRD planner/noise context
- `prepared_noise`: a `NOISE` object containing the aligned nested high-res noise
- `lowres_planner`: final low-res planner latent

Use this before `SamplerCustomAdvanced` when you want the modular graph equivalent of the all-in-one sampler.

### 3. Scale-Locked CFG Guider

Public guider node for the standard ComfyUI `GUIDER` contract. This applies the scale-lock denoiser correction using a `runtime` from `Scale-Locked Runtime Context` and returns a fresh patched guider instead of mutating the upstream guider object in place.

Important: this node is only the denoiser-side piece. Full SLRD behavior still depends on the paired runtime context so the high-res noise field is aligned with the low-res planner branch.

### 4. Scale-Locked Residual SamplerCustomAdvanced

One-node version of the modular custom-sampling workflow. Internally it now calls the same runtime builder and guider patcher that power the public guider node.

### 5. Scale-Locked Detailer Hook Provider

Experimental Impact Pack / FaceDetailer integration path.

This node returns a `DETAILER_HOOK` object that captures the FaceDetailer crop mask in `post_upscale(...)` and drives the masked residual/manifold correction through the hook's sampler path.

The live hook path is `pre_ksample(...)` plus the custom sampler/runtime integration, not the inert `post_encode(...)` / `pre_decode(...)` pair.

This provider no longer advertises sampler-runtime controls that do not participate in its live sampler-driven hook path. The exposed knobs are the ones that still affect the masked latent correction directly:

- residual lock strength and cutoffs,
- optional manifold companding controls,
- optional `lock_mask` / `manifold_mask`, which are intersected with the FaceDetailer support mask.

Compatibility note: this provider's input signature changed when the inert detailer-only sampler/runtime controls were removed. Older saved workflows that used the previous `Scale-Locked Detailer Hook Provider` input surface will need to be re-wired to the current node inputs.

This has been validated for import/compile in this repo, but not against a live current Impact Pack checkout in this environment.

### 6. Scale-Locked Nested Noise Preview

Utility/debug node to inspect the nested-noise construction separately.

## Suggested modular workflow

For standard ComfyUI custom sampling:

1. Build your base `GUIDER` normally.
2. Build `sigmas` and choose your `sampler` normally.
3. Run `Scale-Locked Runtime Context` with the base `noise`, `guider`, `sampler`, `sigmas`, and target latent.
4. Run `Scale-Locked CFG Guider` on the base guider using the returned `runtime`; this returns a fresh patched guider and leaves the base guider untouched.
5. Feed `prepared_noise` and the patched guider into `SamplerCustomAdvanced`.

That path uses the same SLRD runtime pieces as the all-in-one sampler instead of duplicating planner/noise logic.

## FaceDetailer / Impact Pack note

A public guider node alone does not make FaceDetailer use SLRD. `Scale-Locked Detailer Hook Provider` is the experimental integration point for applying the masked residual/manifold correction inside the FaceDetailer crop lifecycle.

The current hook implementation is duck-typed rather than source-verified against a live Impact Pack checkout:

- FaceDetailer mask capture via `post_upscale(...)`,
- alias-tolerant request capture via `pre_ksample(...)`,
- masked latent correction via the custom sampler/runtime path.

Because Impact Pack's internal contracts can move, this integration should be treated as unverified runtime glue until it is exercised against the current Impact Pack source.

## Installation

Clone or copy this directory into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` folder:

```bash
git clone <this-repo> ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-ScaleLockedResidualDiffusion
```

Then restart ComfyUI.

No extra Python dependencies are required beyond ComfyUI + PyTorch.

## Suggested first settings for Flux.2 Klein 9B style use

For a first test when your high-res target is around 4 MP:

- `target_megapixels = 1.0`
- `lock_strength = 0.85`
- `lock_strength_start = 0.95`
- `lock_strength_end = 0.25`
- `lock_schedule = hold_then_drop`
- `lock_schedule_hold = 0.35`
- `lock_schedule_power = 3.0`
- `coarse_cutoff = 0.33`
- `mid_band_cutoff = 0.60`
- `mid_band_strength = 0.35`
- `mid_band_schedule = linked`
- `sampler_guard = warn`
- `nested_noise_strength = 0.35`

If the result still drifts too much:
- raise `lock_strength` toward `0.95`
- lower `coarse_cutoff` toward `0.25`
- use a `lock_mask` over body / face / hands

If the result feels too constrained / too similar to the low-res planner:
- lower `mid_band_strength`
- raise `mid_band_cutoff`
- lower `lock_strength`
- raise `coarse_cutoff`
- lower `lock_strength_end`

## Current limitations

This is a carefully implemented MVP, not a mathematically complete research system.

What is already implemented:
- low-res planner trajectory capture,
- nested-noise initialization,
- denoised-space low-frequency locking,
- denoised-space mid-frequency locking,
- residual-preserving coarse-field replacement,
- optional pinned-memory anchor staging,
- conservative sampler-alignment safety gating,
- optional spatial masking,
- modular `GUIDER` exposure,
- Impact-facing detailer hook/provider path.

What is not implemented yet:
- automatic anatomy / pose / segmentation mask extraction,
- explicit residual-only tiled model execution,
- sigma-perfect trajectory matching for samplers that perform unusual extra model evaluations,
- scheduled cutoff animation for coarse or mid bands,
- multi-stage 1 MP -> 2 MP -> 4 MP progressive ladder inside one node,
- exact support tuning for every possible exotic custom sampler,
- verified bindings for every historical Impact Pack hook/provider variant.
